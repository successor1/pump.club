# Memex Launchpad

Memex is a sophisticated decentralized application (dApp) designed for creating and managing token launchpads on EVM-compatible blockchain networks. The platform leverages smart contracts to ensure secure, transparent, and efficient token launches while minimizing deployment costs through innovative clone factory patterns.

## Overview

Memex operates as a full-stack solution combining:

-   Laravel v11.31 backend
-   Vue.js 3.x frontend with Composition API
-   Smart contract infrastructure for EVM networks
-   Web3 authentication system
-   Inertia.js for seamless SPA experience
-   Real-time trading data visualization

## Core Features

-   Automated launchpad creation and management
-   Multi-chain support for EVM-compatible networks
-   Gas-efficient contract deployment via clone factory pattern
-   Web3 wallet authentication
-   Real-time trading charts and statistics
-   Social features including messaging system
-   Token holder tracking and management
-   Comprehensive admin dashboard

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack

-   Laravel v11.31
-   MySQL/PostgreSQL database
-   RESTful API architecture
-   Web3 integration for blockchain interactions

### Frontend Stack

-   Vue.js 3.x with Composition API
-   Tailwind CSS 3.x for styling
-   Inertia.js for SPA functionality
-   Shadcn-vue components
-   Trading view integration for charts

### Blockchain Integration

-   EVM-compatible smart contracts
-   Factory pattern implementation
-   Web3 authentication
-   Multi-chain support

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Factory Pattern Implementation

The system employs a factory pattern for contract deployment, which offers several advantages:

1. **Gas Efficiency**: Utilizes clone proxies to reduce deployment costs by up to 60%
2. **Centralized Management**: Factory serves as a hub for all contract deployments
3. **Standardization**: Ensures consistency across all deployed contracts
4. **Cost Control**: Optimizes gas consumption for contract deployment

### Deployment Costs

Gas costs vary by network:

-   Layer 1 networks (e.g., Ethereum): $8-12 USD
-   Layer 2 networks (e.g., Base): $4-6 USD

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Memex, ensure you have:

1. PHP 8.1 or higher
2. Node.js 16+ and npm
3. Composer
4. Access to an EVM-compatible network
5. Web3 wallet for contract deployment
6. MySQL/PostgreSQL database

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/memex-launchpad.git
cd memex-launchpad
```

2. Install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

3. Install JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Configure environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

5. Set up the database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

6. Deploy factory contract:

-   Choose target network
-   Deploy factory contract using provided scripts
-   Update configuration with factory address

## Factory Contract Deployment

**Important**: A factory contract must be deployed before using the system. This contract:

-   Enables frontend contract deployment functionality
-   Manages deployment configurations
-   Handles fee collection
-   Controls contract creation process

All contracts are verified on network explorers (e.g., BSCScan, BaseScan) for transparency.

## Security Considerations

-   All smart contracts undergo thorough security audits
-   Implements secure Web3 authentication
-   Uses standard security practices for Laravel applications
-   Regular security updates and patches
